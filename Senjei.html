    <h1>Senjei</h1>
      <p>
        Senjei is my best friend, always there when i need him. We love going for walks and playing ball. Although he likes to take the ball or what ever I throw and drop it while deciding he has to pee and on occasion he pees on what he was supposed to be fetching. Senjei at this time of writing is 7 years old. he is a pure bred basenji dog. A lot of people have not heard about the breed but some have. Apperently the egyption hyrogliphs show that these were common during that time. So I guess there is a lot of history about any breed but basenjis are unique. They have been pets in Africa for the tribes people apparently that is where the breed originates from. I have heard rumors saying that these dogs in a large pack would help the tribes people hunt lions. If you seen his quick reflexes and speed comparable to a greyhound you would know why. He is definently wiley and I do call him that, he loves to play rough but can get carried away.
